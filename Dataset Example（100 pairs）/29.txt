A non-Abelian circuit composed of a C3 symmetric structure and coupling elements represented by md0, mid0, md1, m_d2 and mid3. The transfer function coefficient vector is [3.56e-17 + 5.9e-18i, - 0.0694 - 0.0408i, - 0.0676 - 0.04i], and coupling is achieved using 2.7nF capacitors and 1000 ohm resistors. The node connection components are 4C and 2.5R.
