A non-Abelian circuit composed of a C3 symmetric structure and coupling elements represented by md0, m_id0, md1, md2 and m_id3. The transfer function coefficient vector is [1.69e-17 - 6.13e-17i, 0.0411 - 0.00132i, - 0.0478 + 0.0958i], and coupling is achieved using 2.7nF capacitors and 1000 ohm resistors. The node connection components are 7C and 0.5R.
