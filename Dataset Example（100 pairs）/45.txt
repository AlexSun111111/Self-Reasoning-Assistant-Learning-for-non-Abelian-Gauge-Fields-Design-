A non-Abelian circuit composed of a C3 symmetric structure and coupling elements represented by md0, m_id0, md1, mid2 and md3. The transfer function coefficient vector is [9.46e-17 - 7.14e-17i, - 0.0741 - 0.118i, - 0.092 - 0.00736i], and coupling is achieved using 2.7nF capacitors and 1000 ohm resistors. The node connection components are C and 4R.
