A non-Abelian circuit composed of a C3 symmetric structure and coupling elements represented by md0, m_d0, md1, mid2 and m_d3. The transfer function coefficient vector is [1.13e-16 + 5.96e-17i, 0.148 - 0.118i, 0.166 - 0.085i], and coupling is achieved using 2.7nF capacitors and 1000 ohm resistors. The node connection components are 3C and 3R.
