A non-Abelian circuit composed of a C3 symmetric structure and coupling elements represented by md0, mid0, md1, mid2 and m_id3. The transfer function coefficient vector is [7.18e-17 + 6.99e-17i, 0.0302 + 0.0871i, - 0.0052 - 0.0247i], and coupling is achieved using 2.7nF capacitors and 1000 ohm resistors. The node connection components are 4C and 3.5R.
