A non-Abelian circuit composed of a C3 symmetric structure and coupling elements represented by md0, mid0, md1, md2 and mid3. The transfer function coefficient vector is [0, 0.00451 - 0.0164i, 0.0315 + 0.0316i], and coupling is achieved using 2.7nF capacitors and 1000 ohm resistors. The node connection components are 7C and 2R.
