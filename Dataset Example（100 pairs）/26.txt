A non-Abelian circuit composed of a C3 symmetric structure and coupling elements represented by md0, mid0, md1, m_d2 and m_d3. The transfer function coefficient vector is [1.33e-17 + 5.97e-18i, 0.00887 + 0.0308i, 0.00892 + 0.0303i], and coupling is achieved using 2.7nF capacitors and 1000 ohm resistors. The node connection components are 4C and 3.5R.
