A non-Abelian circuit composed of a C3 symmetric structure and coupling elements represented by md0, m_id0, md1, mid2 and mid3. The transfer function coefficient vector is [6.7e-18 + 8.23e-18i, - 0.206 - 0.0966i, 0.0536 + 0.0402i]
, and coupling is achieved using 2.7nF capacitors and 1000 ohm resistors. The node connection components are 4C and 2.5R.
