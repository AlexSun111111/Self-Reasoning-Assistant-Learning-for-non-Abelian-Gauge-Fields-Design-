A non-Abelian circuit composed of a C3 symmetric structure and coupling elements represented by md0, m_id0, md1, m_d2 and mid3. The transfer function coefficient vector is [4.77e-17 - 6.34e-17i, - 0.0807 + 0.0327i, 0.0258 + 0.021i], and coupling is achieved using 2.7nF capacitors and 1000 ohm resistors. The node connection components are 7C and R.
