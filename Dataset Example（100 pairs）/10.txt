A non-Abelian circuit composed of a C3 symmetric structure and coupling elements represented by md0, mid0, md1, md2 and m_d3. The transfer function coefficient vector is [0, 0.0217 - 0.0229i, - 0.0311 - 0.00771i], and coupling is achieved using 2.7nF capacitors and 1000 ohm resistors. The node connection components are 4C and 3.5R.
