A non-Abelian circuit composed of a C3 symmetric structure and coupling elements represented by md0, m_d0, md1, mid2 and md3. The transfer function coefficient vector is [2.27e-16 + 1.35e-17i, - 0.198 + 0.158i, - 0.124 + 0.0633i], and coupling is achieved using 2.7nF capacitors and 1000 ohm resistors. The node connection components are 3C and 3R.
