A non-Abelian circuit composed of a C3 symmetric structure and coupling elements represented by md0, md1, mid2 and m_id3. The transfer function coefficient vector is [2.39e-17 + 7.53e-17i, 0.0361 - 0.129i, 0.115 - 0.00754i], and coupling is achieved using 2.7nF capacitors and 1000 ohm resistors. The node connection components are 5C and 1.5R.
