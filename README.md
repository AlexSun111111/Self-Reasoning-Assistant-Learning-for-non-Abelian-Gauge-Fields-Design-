# Self-Reasoning Assistant Learning for Non-Abelian Gauge Fields

## Abstract
This project develops a novel self-reasoning assistant learning framework to generate non-Abelian gauge fields. It highlights the application of advanced machine learning techniques to interpret and operationalize complex physical theories.

## Introduction
Non-Abelian gauge fields play a critical role in various areas of theoretical physics. This project introduces an innovative computational framework leveraging self-reasoning assistant learning to design and simulate circuits capable of manifesting non-Abelian gauge fields, facilitating experimental investigations into their properties.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexSun111111/Self-Reasoning-Assistant-Learning-for-non-Abelian-Gauge-Fields-Design-.git
cd Self-Reasoning-Assistant-Learning-for-non-Abelian-Gauge-Fields-Design-
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
